Git Development Workflow
========================

The Git-based website development workflow offered by Pantheon and Acquia is easy to use,
but complex to setup. If need/want a similar dev/test/live workflow on your own server,
this script will set up nearly everything.

Notes
----
This uses Ansible for configuration management and is designed for use with
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
